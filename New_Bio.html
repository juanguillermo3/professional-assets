      <strong>Juan Guillermo Osío Jaramillo</strong>, <em>B.A. in Economics</em>, is an expert in applied statistical modeling and software-based automation for analytical purposes. His professional project aims to modernize the delivery of data analysis through emerging technologies such as machine learning, software and algorithmic automation, big data, natural language processing, modern tools, and LLM-powered applications. Juan is literally obsessed with combining these techniques to create software applications that can work more flexibly with data — and with information in general. As a mildly autistic person, Juan uses “literally” in the literal sense. As a bonus point, Juan approaches data analysis as a professional economist — i.e., with a focus on causal analysis, marginal effects, counterfactual analysis, and explaining emergent properties of complex social and corporate systems from incentives and individual behavior.
